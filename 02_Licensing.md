## Licensing your code

- Berne Convention


## Free software or open source software

- The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
- The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
- The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).
- The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.


## When to make your code open

- Explicit permission of every co-author and copyright holder is needed.

- In the case of an industrial collaboration they might not want the code to be made public. 


## Potential fears of open sourceing the code

- If the code is made public their work will be "stolen" by another University.

- Someone will find an embarrassing bug in it.


## Potential solutions

- Hold off the opening of the software until the paper is submitted/published.

- Embarassing to have a paper submitted and then find a bug later. 
    - By opening your code and allowing more contributions you increase the quality of the code.

## How to make your code free and open

- Choose a licence, agreed by everyone on the project.
- Put the licence text in a file alongside your code.
- Publish your code somewhere such as GitHub or GitLab.


## Choose a licence

- There are lots of possible ways to license your code, with their own pros and cons. e.g. a website like [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com).

- How permissive you want to be, e.g. MIT license.

## Apply the licence

 - Most licenses rewquire a single file like `LICENSE` or `LICENSE.txt`.

- Some licences advise that you should put a message at the top of every file.

## Publish

- GitHub
