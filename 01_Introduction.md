# Introduction

Welcome to a short course which will introduce you to some techniques and processes which are essential if you are going to be developing professional-quality software.

For this course we will be focusing on three main topics:
1. documentation
2. licensing
3. testing

and discussing why they're important and how to integrate them into your code.

To discover these concepts we will be exploring then in Python but the ideas behind what we're doing here apply to all programming languages. You can do documentation and testing in C, C++, R, Fortran, Julia, Go and Rust but each will have their own tools and techniques. Languages which make going these things easy are good languages for doing software development in.
